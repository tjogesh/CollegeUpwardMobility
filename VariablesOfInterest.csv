Separate metrics are calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. This metric is calculated as the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate divided by the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates in the corresponding completion rate cohort. For full-time, first-time, bachelor's degree-seeking undergraduates, 150 percent of normal time is typically 6 years, and for full-time, first-time, associate's degree-seeking undergraduates it is typically 3 years. For full-time, first-time, certificate-seeking undergraduates, the normal time period varies by the length of the program (for example, 9 months for a certificate with a normal completion time of 6 months). Race/ethnicity categories for completion rates have varied over time. Prior to the 2008-09 academic year, the categories were White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, Nonresident Alien, and Unknown. Starting in the 2011-12 academic year, the categories were White, Black/African American, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Two or More Races, Nonresident Alien, and Unknown.
